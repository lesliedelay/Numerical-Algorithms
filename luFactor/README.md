# LU Factorization Algorithm
This algorithm allows you to utilize the Gauss Elimination method whiule implementing pivoting and incooperates other methods to create LU Factorization. This method allows you to easily solve a system of equations while obtaining information on both the upper and lower triangular matrix, as well as the pivoted identitiy matrix. 
## The input includes:
**input:**
A = the matrix that comes from your system of equations. This is better understood as the coefficient matrix taken from your system of equations.
## The outputs include:
**outputs:**
  L = the resulting lower triangular matrix
  U = the resulting upper triangular matrix
  P = the resulting pivot matrix
  
  *These outputs can be utilized to then solve the matrix or to solve for the inverse matrix*
