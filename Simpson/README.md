# Simpson Algorithm
This algorithm uses the Simpson 1/3 rule when there is an even number of segments and implements the trapezoidal rule when to the last segment if there is an odd amount of segments. 
### The inputs include
**input:**
  func = name of function 
  x,y = Where the function numerically evaluates the integral of the vector of function values ‘y’ with respect to ‘x
### The outputs include
  **output:** 
  I = the final answer using the Simpson's rule or both the Simpson and Trapezoidal rules
