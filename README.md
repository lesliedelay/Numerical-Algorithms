## LU Factorization
This algorithm utlizes the Gauss Elimination method with pivoting and incooperates other methods to create LU Factorization.
This method allows you to easily solve a system of equations and avoids possible errors because of the use of pivoting.
## Simpon's Method
This algorithm uses the Simpson 1/3 rule when there is an even number of segments and implements the trapezoidal rule on the last segment if there is an odd amount.
This algorithm simply is in the family of methods that replace a complicated function with polynomial that's easier to integrate.
## False Position
This algorithm's objective is to locate the roots or the zeros of a given function. It is very similar to the bisect method. 
### How to Use
Each of these methods is a code that requires you to call it when given another function of set of data. They are user friendly and have built in errors appriopriate to each code in order for them to be successful, and 'unbreakable'.
